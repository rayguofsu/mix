366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this: Collect and remove all leaves, repeat until the tree is empty.

Example:
Given binary tree

          1
         / \
        2   3
       / \     
      4   5    

Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

Explanation:

1. Removing the leaves [4, 5, 3] would result in this tree:

          1
         / 
        2          

2. Now removing the leaf [2] would result in this tree:

          1          

3. Now removing the leaf [1] would result in the empty tree:

          []         

Returns [4, 5, 3], [2], [1].

 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        height(root, res);
        return res;
    }
    private int height(TreeNode node, List<List<Integer>> res){
        if(null==node)  return -1;
        int level = 1 + Math.max(height(node.left, res), height(node.right, res));
        if(res.size()<level+1)  res.add(new ArrayList<>());
        res.get(level).add(node.val);
        return level;
    }
}
/*For this question we need to take bottom-up approach. The key is to find the height of each node. Here the definition of height is:
The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf. --CMU 15-121 Binary Trees

I used a helper function to return the height of current node. According to the definition, the height of leaf is 0. h(node) = 1 + max(h(node.left), h(node.right)).
The height of a node is also the its index in the result list (res). For example, leaves, whose heights are 0, are stored in res[0]. Once we find the height of a node, we can put it directly into the result.

UPDATE:
Thanks @adrianliu0729 for pointing out that my previous code does not actually remove leaves. I added one line node.left = node.right = null; to remove visited nodes

UPDATE:
There seems to be some debate over whether we need to actually "remove" leaves from the input tree. Anyway, it is just a matter of one line code. In the actual interview, just confirm with the interviewer whether removal is required.*/
