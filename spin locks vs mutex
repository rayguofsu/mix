In theory, when a thread tries to lock a mutex and it does not succeed, 
because the mutex is already locked, it will go to sleep, 
immediately allowing another thread to run. 
It will continue to sleep until being woken up, 
which will be the case once the mutex is being unlocked by whatever thread was holding the lock before. 
When a thread tries to lock a spinlock and it does not succeed, it will continuously re-try locking it, 
until it finally succeeds; 
thus it will not allow another thread to take its place 
(however, the operating system will forcefully switch to another thread, 
once the CPU runtime quantum of the current thread has been exceeded, of course).
