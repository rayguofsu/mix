We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

Given a particular n ≥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.



我们假定选择了一个错误的数x，（1<=x<=n && x!=y ）那么就知道接下来应该从[1,x-1 ] 或者[x+1,n]中进行查找。 假如我们已经解决了[1,x-1] 和 [x+1,n]计算问题，我们将其表示为solve(L,x-1) 和solve(x+1,n)，那么我们应该选择max(solve(L,x-1),solve(x+1,n)) 这样就是求最坏情况下的损失。总的损失就是 f(x) = x + max(solve(L,x-1),solve(x+1,n))

那么将x从1~n进行遍历，取使得 f(x) 达到最小，来确定最坏情况下最小的损失，也就是我们初始应该选择哪个数。

上面的说法其实是一个自顶向下的过程（Top-down），可以用递归来解决。很容易得到如下的代码（这里用了记忆化搜索）：



public class Solution {
    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][n+1];
        return solve(dp, 1, n);
    }
    int solve(int[][] dp, int L, int R) {
		if (L >= R) return 0;
		if (dp[L][R] != 0) return dp[L][R];
		dp[L][R] = 0x7FFFFFFF;
		for (int i = L; i <= R; i++) {
			dp[L][R] = Math.min(dp[L][R], i + Math.max(solve(dp,L,i-1),solve(dp,i+1,R)));
		}
		return dp[L][R];
	}
}
