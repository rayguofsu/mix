Imple­men­ta­tion:

    Use array to store the data.
    Start stor­ing from index 1, not 0.
    For any given node at posi­tion i:
    Its Left Child is at [2*i] if available.
    Its Right Child is at [2*i+1] if available.
    Its Par­ent Node is at [i/2]if avail­able.


Insert Oper­a­tion:

    Add the ele­ment at the bot­tom leaf of the Heap.
    Per­form the Bubble-Up operation.
    All Insert Oper­a­tions must per­form the bubble-up oper­a­tion(it is also called as up-heap, percolate-up, sift-up, trickle-up, heapify-up, or cascade-up)


Delete/pop Oper­a­tion:

    Find the index for the ele­ment to be deleted. (INdex is 1 for pop up)
    Take out the last ele­ment from the last level from the heap and replace the index with this element .
    Per­form Sink-Down
