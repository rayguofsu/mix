209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Total Accepted: 28602 Total Submissions: 111239 Difficulty: Medium

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log n). (guess this is by sort it first; then do binary search)
public class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int s, int[] nums) {
        
    }
}

dynamic sliding window
We will maintain a window that grows until sum reach the given sum. Once the window grows to sum at least s then we can start shirking the window from left with the hope to find a smaller window. We shrink until sum falls below s. Then we can grow the window on right again and so on. We keep this procedure of growing-shrinking until the window start reaches the end of the array. Below is the implementation of the above idea which runs in O(n) time and O(1) space.

public class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int s, int[] nums) {













       int start = 0;
       int end = 0;
       int cuSum = 0;
       int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
       while (end < nums.length){
          //if current window doesn't add up to the given sum then 
          //strech the window to right
          if (cuSum < s){
             cuSum += nums[end];
             end++;
          }
          //if current window adds up to at least given sum then
          //we can shrink the window 
          while (cuSum >= s){ //cannot use else if, as else if will miss cuSum at last entry
             minLen = Math.min(minLen, end - start);
             cuSum -= nums[start];
             start++;
          }
       }
       return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLen;
    }
}
